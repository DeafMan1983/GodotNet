# GodotNet

# Why is GodotNet?
Dotnet + Godot = (Go)Dotnet -> Replaces with "GodotNet".

# Oh, is it good that Godot replaces into Dotnet Framework (Net 6.0x )?
Because Mono-Runtime is already died on Ubuntu 22.04 since I got many critical problem with repository of Mono-Project and it said Error with i586 packages or ignored warnings and I have tested - Oh it is really sad because Godot for Mono worked crashed end since I ran `bin/godot.x11.tools.64.mono`

# Oh well bye bye Mono-Project!
Yes we need move to #Dotnet. Do not worry! Microsoft would care everyone without super rich ex boss Bill Gates and can make sure for nice future with Net 6.0 and Net 7.x ( preview )

# Why is Dotnet better Mono-Runtime?
Because Dotnet has a lot of new features with `dotnet workload`. It means you can bundle into wasm-tools, win-x64, linux-x64, osx-x64, ios-arm, android-arm and more... 

# If we would like to create GodotNet into web based application via Webassembly ( WASM )?
I am sure that. Because Microsoft releases with built-in Emscription in SDK like [dotnet6-webgl-sample](https://github.com/AshleighAdams/dotnet6-webgl-sample) That is nice example with WaveEngine but for me I make custom like WaveEngine's OpenGLES

# Now do you would like to help in our development with GodotNet?
Than I will release in private repository soon...

I hope you accept my idea for GodotNet with Net 6.x

Thanks for reading and for supporting my work!
