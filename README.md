# GodotNet
Porting from C++/C Godot because Mono Runtime looks died for latest Linux OS Versions. So sad when I run Godot 3.4.4-Stable for Linux with Mono-Runtime then it crashed like cannot run yet. That is why I want replace to complete Dotnet single file from #Net6.0 And I will work hard with Dotnet and VS Code - I promise you that @GodotEngine, I never publish if I release for everything. I will use private for @GodotEngineTeams.
